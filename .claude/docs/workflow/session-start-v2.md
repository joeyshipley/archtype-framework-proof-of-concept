# Session Start

## Step 1: Read Core Docs

Read these files first, every session:
1. `.claude/docs/README.md` - Project overview and navigation
2. `.claude/docs/README.PHILOSOPHY.md` - Core beliefs, HTTP-first, vertical slices
3. `.claude/docs/README.ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md` - Technical patterns
4. `.claude/docs/README.DESIGN_STYLING.md` - CSS, tokens, theming

## Step 2: What Are You Working On?

Ask the user what they'd like to work on.

### New Work

If user has new intent to structure:
1. Follow `.claude/docs/workflow/brief-creation-v2.md`
2. Create brief with Goal, Problem, Success Signal, Constraints
3. Break into phases
4. Start Phase 1 research

### Existing Brief

If user references existing brief:
1. Read the brief
2. Find current phase (first incomplete phase)
3. Follow `.claude/docs/workflow/phase-workflow.md`
4. Resume: Research → Plan → Execute → Validate

### Quick Task

If user has a small, clear task (no brief needed):
1. Confirm scope is small
2. Execute directly
3. No ceremony required

## Collaboration Signals

**Listen for uncertainty:**
- "Something feels off..." → Pause, explore the concern
- "I'm not sure about..." → Capture in Open Questions
- "Wait, should we..." → Worth investigating before continuing

**Context collapse indicators:**
- Bugs appearing → Step back, smaller slices
- Workarounds needed → Architecture question, explore first
- Confusion → Missing context, read more before acting
