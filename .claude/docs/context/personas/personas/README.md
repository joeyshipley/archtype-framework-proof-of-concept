# Personas

Quick reference for all user personas. Use these when writing briefs to identify your target user.

## Readers

- **eager-explorer.md** - Primary target (11yo, moderate tech, wants to be hero)
- **completionist.md** - Power user (13yo, high tech, achievement hunter)
- **cautious-sampler.md** - Free tier (10yo, low confidence, needs simplicity)
- **social-reader.md** - Teen (15yo, phone-first, shares everything)

## Authors

- **aspiring-novelist.md** - Primary author (teacher, low tech, needs hand-holding)
- **worldbuilder.md** - Advanced author (developer, wants complexity)
- **part-timer.md** - Casual author (writes for fun, inconsistent availability)

## Admin

- **platform-owner.md** - You (framework validation, sustainable business)
- **content-moderator.md** - Future hire (ensures child safety)

## Parents

- **concerned-parent.md** - Gate keeper (safety-focused, will pay for quality)

**Using personas in briefs:** Reference by role (e.g., "For: eager-explorer") to clarify who you're building for.
