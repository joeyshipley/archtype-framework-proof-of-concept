- Fix file naming. Those pages shouldn't have .htmx in them now.
- ThemeComplier - consider throwing errors if a non-token is used. 
- Fix all of the context loading docs. They use old implementations.
- Come up with actual web theme.
- Review, what else do we need before we can create an actual website?
- Refactor and move framework into a Archtype.Framework project.
- Advanced UI interactions: drag and drop, autocomplete dropdown, pagination/filtering/sorting tables, etc.
